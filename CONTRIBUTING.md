# Contributing to OVERKILL-PI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OVERKILL-PI! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Focus on constructive criticism
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/overkill-pi.git
   cd overkill-pi
   ```
3. Add upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/flashingcursor/overkill-pi.git
   ```

## Development Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Making Changes

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Write Code

- Follow the existing code style
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### 3. Code Style

We use Black for code formatting and flake8 for linting:

```bash
# Format code
black overkill/

# Check linting
flake8 overkill/

# Type checking
mypy overkill/
```

### 4. Write Tests

- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for >80% code coverage

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=overkill --cov-report=html
```

### 5. Update Documentation

- Update README.md if adding features
- Update INSTALL.md for installation changes
- Add/update docstrings
- Update TESTING.md if adding test cases

## Commit Guidelines

### Examples

```
feat(overclock): add silicon quality testing

Implement comprehensive stress testing to grade silicon quality.
Tests run progressively from stock to extreme profiles.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(thermal): correct PWM frequency calculation

PWM frequency was calculated in Hz instead of kHz,
causing incorrect fan speeds on some systems.
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout master
   git merge upstream/master
   ```

2. **Rebase your feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/your-feature
   git rebase master
   ```

3. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**:
   - Go to GitHub and create a PR from your fork
   - Fill in the PR template
   - Link any related issues
